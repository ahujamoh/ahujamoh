### Why Gatsby?

- Want a modern, fun to work with, static site generator that doesn't have `old-school` features like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)? :heavy_check_mark:

- Have experience working with React, GraphQL and its ecosystem? :heavy_check_mark:

- Look for a tool that can handle the performance by itself and leave you with other fun parts? :heavy_check_mark:

### What about Typescript?

- Don't understand the meanings of React components written in Javascript? :heavy_check_mark:

- Want to track and catch bugs immediately? :heavy_check_mark:

- Want to add static type checking to Javascript? :heavy_check_mark:

- Heard lots of people talking about it and want to join? :heavy_check_mark:

### Enough checkmarks, what do the rest do?

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org)**: A linter tool that forces you to write qualified code.

- **[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io)**: A linter tool like ESlint but for CSS and styled-components.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)**: A formatter tool that provides a standard structure for your code.

- **[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)**: Allows us to execute pre-commit commands.

- **[Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)**: Runs all linters on staged git files.

### Real works began...

I recommend you to fork [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)
or [gatsby-starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world). The reason is that these
two starter boilerplates will give the basic and essential parts for developing a Gatsby project. The different between
these two is that [gatsby-starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsby-starter-hello-world) only contains a set of core
features, which means you're gonna build your site from scratch.

In this blog, I will use [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

##### Create a new Gatsby project

  ```bash
      gatsby new <your_repo_name> https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
  ```
